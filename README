# Ansible Role: OpenVPN

This Ansible role allows you to install and configure both an **OpenVPN server** and an **OpenVPN client**.


## Requirements

The OpenVPN server requires the following Python dependencies to be installed on the target machine:
- `requests`
- `packaging`
- `pexpect`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install requests packaging pexpect
```

This role relies also on the Docker image [`kylemanna/openvpn`](https://hub.docker.com/r/kylemanna/openvpn) to set up the OpenVPN server. Ensure that Docker is installed and properly configured on the server where the role will run.

## Role Variables

The following variables must be defined for the role to work. For sensitive values, it is recommended to use **Ansible Vault** in production environments.

| Variable                      | Description                                  | Required | Example                  |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| `openvpn_ca_password`         | Password for the Certificate Authority (CA) | Yes      | `"securepassword123"`    |
| `openvpn_client_password`     | Password for the OpenVPN client             | Yes      | `"anothersecurepassword"`|
| `openvpn_server_dns`          | DNS for the OpenVPN server                  | Yes      | `"vpn.example.com"`      |
| `openvpn_server_ansible_host` | Hostname or IP address of the OpenVPN server| Yes      | `"192.168.1.100"`        |

**Example Playbook:**
```yaml
- hosts: openvpn_server
  become: true
  vars:
    openvpn_ca_password: "your_ca_password"  # Use Ansible Vault in production
    openvpn_client_password: "your_client_password"  # Use Ansible Vault in production
    openvpn_server_dns: "vpn.example.com"
    openvpn_server_ansible_host: "192.168.1.100"
  roles:
    - pyronear.openvpn
```

## Local Testing with Molecule

You can test this role locally using [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Molecule automates the process of creating test environments (e.g., Docker containers), applying the role, and validating its idempotence.

### Setup

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install molecule[docker]
   ```

2. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   molecule test
   ```

### Molecule Configuration

The `molecule` directory contains all the configurations needed to test this role. Specifically:
- The OpenVPN server and client are tested in separate containers.
- Python dependencies and any additional setup are handled automatically during the Molecule execution.
